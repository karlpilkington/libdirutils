@node A Quick Introduction
@chapter A Quick Introduction

@pindex intro
@cindex introduction to @command{libdirutils}
@command{libdirutils} is a utility library inspired by similar functionality
in the Go and Python programming languages; it provides functions similar
to @command{rm -r} and @command{mkdir -p}, as well as a convenience function
to combine the functionality of @command{access(2)} and @command{stat(2)}.
It provides these functions as convenience functions for working with files
and directories; as the name implies, it is aimed primarily at directories.

@node Functions Provided
@chapter Functions Provided

@pindex functions
@cindex functions provided

@section makedirs
@example
int
makedirs(const char *path, size_t path_len);
@end example
@command{makedirs} creates a path and all required parent directories. The
mode created is the processâ€™s @command{umask(2)} value applied to 0777.
It returns @command{EXIT_SUCCESS} on success and @command{EXIT_FAILURE}
on failure.

@section rmdirs
@example
int
rmdirs(const char *path, size_t path_len);
@end example
@command{rmdirs} removes a path and all subdirectories and files.
It returns @command{EXIT_SUCCESS} on success and @command{EXIT_FAILURE}
on failure.

@section path_exists
@example
EXISTS_STATUS
path_exists(const char *path, size_t path_len);
@end example
@command{path_exists} combines the functionality of @command{access(2)} and
@command{stat(2)}. It checks whether the process has access to the file and
indicates whether it is a regular file, a directory, or if an error occurs.
The return type is of the enumeration EXISTS_STATUS, which is one of

@itemize
@item @command{EXISTS_ERROR}: there was an error looking up the file;
@item @command{EXISTS_NOENT}: the file does not exist;
@item @command{EXISTS_NOPERM}: the process does not have the appropriate
permissions to access the file.
@item @command{EXISTS_DIR}: the file is a directory;
@item @command{EXISTS_FILE}: the file is a regular file; and
@item @command{EXISTS_OTHER}: the file could be read and is not a directory
or regular file.

@section Dependencies
If you will be running the unit tests, @url{http://cunit.sourceforge.net/,CUnit}
is required. If you will be rebuilding the autotools build infrastructure,
you will need automake 1.11 and autoconf >= 2.59.

@section Development Repository
The source code repository is available on
@url{https://github.com/kisom/libdirutils,Github}.
The code there is in the original autotools source; the @command{autogen.sh}
script is provided to run through a complete build, including running through
the provided unit tests:

@example
$ git clone https://github.com/kisom/libdirutils.git dirutils
$ cd dirutils
$ ./autobuild.sh
@end example

Several utility scripts are provided in the @command{scripts} subdirectory;
the @command{autobuild.sh} script calls these. Of note, the
@command{prebuild.sh}
script, which will set the necessary autotools environment variables and call
@command{autoreconf}.

@section Release Tarballs
Release tarballs will be made available via the Github repository's
@url{https://github.com/kisom/libdirutils/downloads,downloads} section.

Once unpacked, these can be built with the normal
@command{./configure && make && make install} methods. See
@command{./configure --help} for additional configuration options.
